# Henry McKinney's Performance Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks detailing comprehensive analyses of hockey player Henry McKinney's performance using InStat's dataset and correlating physiological data from WHOOP.

## Notebooks

- `Henry_Instat_Analysis_and_DataViz.ipynb`: Analyzes game performance metrics and visualizes trends in scoring, assists, and on-ice time.
- `Recovery_x_Instat_Index.ipynb`: Explores the relationship between WHOOP recovery scores, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and performance indexes.

## Description

The `Henry_Instat_Analysis_and_DataViz` notebook focuses on time series analysis of performance metrics, correlation studies, and contextual game analysis. In contrast, `Recovery_x_Instat_Index` aims to identify potential trends between WHOOP physiological metrics and InStat performance scores.

### Insights and Highlights

- Monthly average analysis of InStat Index
- Statistical correlations between time on ice and performance
- Visualizations of game by game trends
- The association of WHOOP's recovery score and HRV with InStat Index

## Installation & Personal use of Code
The analysis is conducted in Jupyter Notebooks. To run these notebooks, ensure that you have Jupyter installed, which is part of the Anaconda distribution, or you can install it using PIP:

`pip install notebook`
Once installed, clone the repository and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the notebooks.
